## 📽️ Media

- [LibreTube](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.libretube/) - The best YouTube client APK I have seen so far. Helps you watch YouTube smoothly by blocking distractions, without ads, with background playback, and high performance. `If you are a productivity enthusiast, I highly recommend trying it out. If you often find yourself falling into a rabbit hole while watching YouTube on your phone, this app will save you.`
- [FreeTube](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/io.freetubeapp.freetube) - Another YouTube client APK. Good for its UI, distraction blocker feature, and performance.
- [YouTube ReVanced](https://vanced.to/#download) - A great YouTube alternative. If you really want the full YouTube Premium experience through the YouTube app, you must replace the official YouTube with this. `I disabled the official YouTube app and keep this on my phone.`
- [Next Player](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer/) - Minimal Local video player app. Alternative to Mx-player.
- [mpvEx](https://mpvex.vercel.app/) 🔥 - Minimal, Elegant, Distraction & ads free beautiful looking local video player. This app is what I was really looking for. Now it's my favourite video player app on my phone and I absolutely love it. Replaced mx-player & next-player with it. `For almost 1.5–2 years, I used Next Player as my local video player app. I don't like MX Player or others because they are bloated and not ad‑free.`
- [Gramophone](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.akanework.gramophone/) - A minimal local audio player app with a clean UI.
- [Symphony](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.zyrouge.symphony/) - Another minimal local audio player app but with a more beautiful UI.
- [Simp Music](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.maxrave.simpmusic/) - A cool YouTube Music client app I've been using since the end of 2024.
- [Vivi](https://vivimusic.vercel.app/) 💖 - A really pretty YouTube Music client app. I fell in love with its elegant and modern UI design and features. `I stopped using Simp‑Music and started using Vivi.`
- [Rootless JamesDSP](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.timschneeberger.rootlessjamesdsp/) - An equalizer app built for non‑rooted devices. It works with the help of Shizuku (a special Android app).
- [Echo Equalizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hapibits.soundlift&hl=en_SG&pli=1) - Another elegant and more beautiful equalizer app. I uninstalled Rootless JamesDSP and started using it.
- [FadCam](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fadcam/) - A cool open‑source background video recorder. I love it for its elegant UI and cool features.
- [Image Toolbox](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ru.tech.imageresizershrinker/) - A fantastic image editor.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🔐 Security

- [App Lock](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.pranav.applock/) - An open‑source, ad‑free app locker. I was interested in it, but I faced some bugs/issues, which is why I'm not using it now. `Must‑try if you want to lock apps with a third‑party app.`
- [Private Lock](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.wesaphzt.privatelock/) - This is a must‑have on everyone's phone. This app helps lock your phone by shaking it. If a thief steals your phone and runs away while you are using Facebook (screen unlocked), the phone's screen will automatically lock due to the movement. `Tip: download this app and rename it to something like "FM Radio" or "Maps" so that other people won't detect there is a locker that might lock the screen.`
- [Paranoid's Pal](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.paranoid.privacylock/) - Another screen locker triggered by shaking the phone. (Alternative to Private Lock.) I recommend using Private Lock.
- [LockMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.dekar.lockme) - Really helpful in some cases. This allows you to lock the screen with its movement detection feature. After locking, if your phone is moved from one position to another, the app will start playing a loud sound. You are asleep and someone takes your phone and moves; the sound will play and wake you up.
- [Amarok](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/deltazero.amarok.foss/) - Allows you to hide your apps from the launcher. But it is not a typical app hider. It is open source, minimal, and lets you hide apps with a special technique. The app won't launch until you unhide it. Even after restarting the phone, the app stays hidden.
- [Screen Lock](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.tiendnm.zukulock) - A tiny, high‑performance, small‑sized, one‑tap screen locker. But wait—this app doesn't use accessibility services; instead, it uses Shizuku, which is why it won't affect phone performance, and I love it.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🚀 Productivity

- [Olauncher](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.olauncher/) 💖 - From January 2026, I started using this minimal launcher. This launcher gives me peace by cutting digital temptation.
- [Standby Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samvd.standby&hl=en_SG) - Turns your phone into a desk clock while studying. If you are an aesthetic lover and productivity enthusiast, you must use this app. This app is ad‑free and provides lots of clock styles.
- [Tomato](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.nsh07.pomodoro/) - An ad‑free, open‑source, minimal Material UI‑based Pomodoro timer.
- [Todoist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&hl=en_SG) - The best to‑do list app for me. I've explored almost every top to‑do list app, but Todoist is the king of all of them. (Personal opinion.)
- [Alarmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan&hl=en_SG) - This app is a **must‑have** if you want to wake up early. It offers multiple wake‑up missions to stop the alarm, including **math**, **walking**, **exercise**, and **QR‑code scanning**. I personally love the **QR‑code scan** mission and have been using it since **December 2024**. I keep a QR code **a few steps away from my bed**, which forces me to get up, walk a bit, and scan the code to stop the alarm. This simple setup **forces my brain to fully wake up**—no snoozing, no excuses. ⏰🔥 `This app allows you to set up restrictions like: you can't uninstall the app during an alarm, can't reduce the alarm volume, can't use other apps, and can't snooze more than your selected limit.`
- [App Search](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pnhdroid.appsearch&hl=en_SG) - An app searcher. Helps you find apps quickly and can also be set up as an assistant to launch from anywhere on your phone, opening a pop‑up window.
- [Pixel Search](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.pixelsearch&hl=en_SG) - Another great app searcher that can also be added as an assistant to launch from anywhere. I love it and use it daily.
- [PTO](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.ferreum.pto/) 🔥 - This is what I was looking for for so long. It allows you to capture thoughts quickly from the lock screen without unlocking the phone—just crazy!! I use it to capture my thoughts and later process the captured notes. `The only missing feature is cloud sync. Notes are saved in local storage.`
- [Timewise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psh.time_wise&hl=en_SG) - Helps you place a time‑progress widget on your home screen. E.g., year, month, day progress.
- [Texpand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isaiasmatewos.texpand&hl=en_SG) - Another crazy time‑saver tool. Allows you to create text snippets with a shortcut name and reuse them in any input field without typing that text again. E.g.: shortcut: `ty`; value: `thank you`. In an input field: if I type `ty`, then `thank you` is pasted automatically.
- [Screen Veil](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screenveil.app&hl=en_SG) 💖 - Lets you turn off your screen without locking it. Helpful when watching YouTube or listening to podcasts but don't want to lock the screen.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 📝 Notes

- [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) - You might already know about this. If not: this is a giant note‑taking & management app (tasks, databases, etc.). It's not a typical note‑taking app but rather a versatile tool. `On Android, Notion has bad performance. I don't use it for regular note‑taking, but I do use it for specific needs.`
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - My favorite note‑taking app. I've used it since July 2024. I love it a lot because of its high performance on Android and PC, and the extensive customization it provides. `My primary note‑taking app. On Android, Notion has bad performance, which is why I shifted to Obsidian when I only had an Android phone. But over time, I fell in love with Obsidian.`
- [AppFlowy](https://appflowy.com/) - Another note‑taking app. It's like a Notion alternative. `I use it only for special types of stuff.`
- [Keep Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en_SG) - A simple note‑taking app from Google. `My secondary note‑taking app. I use it only to store simple information and later quickly search for and use that info.`

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 📚 Reading

- [MJ PDF](https://github.com/mudlej/mj_pdf) - An **ad‑free, open‑source** PDF reader with **dark mode**, **auto‑scroll**, and many useful features. If you read PDFs on Android, I'll say just one thing: **Use this app once.** You might fall in love with its **performance**, **ad‑free experience**, and **clean UI**. 📚
- [Compose PDF](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=soft.aggressivecodings.cpdf&hl=en_SG) - A PDF creator and editor. A really helpful tool. Allows you to reorder pages in a PDF file, create PDFs, etc. Ad‑free experience and elegant UI.
- [Instapaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instapaper.android&hl=en_SG) - A read‑later app. Helpful for reading articles without distractions.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## ⚡ App Management

- [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api) 💖 - A crazy Android app that creates a bridge between apps and advanced Android features that an app normally couldn't access. That's why, with Shizuku, apps can do special things. It's like providing a root‑like experience without rooting.
- [Ice Box](https://modded-1.com/apps/tools/ice-box) - Allows you to freeze apps to improve phone performance and launch them easily from inside the app or by creating a shortcut on the home screen. `Requires Shizuku.`
- [Hail](https://github.com/aistra0528/Hail) - Another great app freezer. But wait! This app provides disable/suspend/force‑stop options. With one click, you can stop all selected apps from running in the background to boost phone performance. `Requires Shizuku. Helps me get a premium experience on my low‑budget Android phone. While average people's phones have lag issues, my phone stays highly performant. 🤩`

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🎨 Customization

- [Color Blender](https://github.com/Mahmud0808/ColorBlendr) - Allows you to customize the Material You colors that come with Android 12+. Those colors affect the lock screen clock, Google Keyboard, and some other places. Actually, the dynamic color that your phone normally takes automatically from the wallpaper can be changed with this app. `Requires Shizuku.`
- [Dockalizer](https://s3.dlandroid.com/apps/Dockalizer-put-a-dock-on-your-phone[dlandroid.com].apk) - A cool, high‑performance app that lets you create a dock like macOS, but it stays hidden. This needs to be set as the default assistant and can be launched anytime by triggering the assistant. It will fade out after a few seconds.
- [Material Photo Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fibelatti.photowidget&hl=en_SG) - A really pretty app that brings the iOS home screen photo widget to Android. Place your favorite photos on your home screen.
- [Show Taps](https://github.com/k3x1n/Android-Show-Taps/issues/6) 🎨🔥 - A really crazy app! Normally, in Developer Options, there is a feature called "Show taps," but that just enables a non‑customizable white/gray circle. This app allows you to enable a tap visualizer with the help of Shizuku that you can customize by changing the color, size, line width, opacity, and even set different colors for different fingers. `Requires Shizuku.`
- [Shortcut Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.shortcutmaker&hl=en_SG) - It's a really helpful tool. A must‑have app. It allows you to create shortcuts to various Android items (apps, settings, phone, contacts, etc.) and place them on the home screen to quickly perform actions.
- [Notification Shortcuts](https://s3.dlandroid.com/apps/Notification-Shortcuts[dlandroid.com].apk) - This might give you a premium experience on your Android phone. Read carefully: by using this app, you can create shortcuts in your notification panel. You can create up to 3 rows, and on each row, you can add up to 12 items. An item can be an app, an app list, a shortcut, a settings toggle, and especially: **you can select "Shortcut" > "Shortcut Maker app" and then create any shortcut you want** 🔥 Allows custom icons for shortcuts. `To customize icons, use Iconify. The crazy thing: it is high‑performance, won't affect performance because it has no active background activity, and does not use accessibility services.`
- [Touch the Notch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notch.touch&hl=en_SG) - Allows you to enable a panel on the status bar. When you tap on the notch area or the right/left side area of the status bar, the panel will display. The panel contains only apps.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 💬 Communication

- [QUIK](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/quik) - An elegant alternative to the default messaging app for Android. I don't like Google Messages on my phone because it doesn't give me a smooth UX. But this app is really high‑performance, minimal, and ad‑free.
- [Click to Chat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trianguloy.openInWhatsapp&hl=en_SG) - This tiny (less than 1 MB) APK allows you to open a WhatsApp chat without saving the number.

- [System UI Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zacharee1.systemuituner&hl=en_SG) - Provides many utilities to customize the behavior of your Android. 💖 My favorite features are: set the back‑gesture edge width (left) to 0 so I can swipe from the left side in any app without triggering the back button; lock‑screen shortcut customization; airplane‑mode tweak to prevent turning off the hotspot in airplane mode, etc. `Requires Shizuku.`
- [Installer X Revived](https://github.com/wxxsfxyzm/InstallerX-Revived) 🔥 - Gives a new look to the app installer UI and delivers a premium vibe. `Requires Shizuku.`
- [Font Gallery](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adeeteya.font_gallery&hl=en_SG) - Allows you to write text & preview it with different fonts to see how it looks in different apps. Helpful for looking up fonts for specific use cases.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🌎 Network

- [LocalSend](https://localsend.org/download) - A local file‑sharing solution between two devices. Provides an elegant UI and a smooth user experience. You need the app on both phones.
- [Sharing](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ammar.sharing/) - Another local file‑sharing solution, but the **crazy** part is that it uses the HTTP protocol and only needs this app on the sender's phone. After starting the service/server on the phone, the other phone can access the UI from a browser to receive files, which will be downloaded.
- [Delta](https://delta.shadoe.dev/) - A hotspot manager for Android. Normally, many phones don't have an option to block users. This app allows you to block users and also provides some other handy features.
- [PlainApp](https://github.com/ismartcoding/plain-app) 🔥 - This is really crazy, and I guarantee you will fall in love with this app. This is an open‑source, ad‑free, minimal‑looking, powerful app that lets you securely manage your phone from a web browser. Access files, media, contacts, SMS, calls, and more through a simple, easy-to-use interface on your desktop and also contains messaging interface to send text/info locally between devices. It also provides a gallery‑like UI to explore photos just like you do on your phone.
- [Network Switch](https://github.com/aunchagaonkar/NetworkSwitch) 🔥 - This is really crazy, **Allows** to swtich network mode between 4G to Auto mode directly from quick settings panel as a **Tile**. (can be customize as needed)

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🌐 Internet

- [Raindrop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.raindrop.raindropio&hl=en_SG) - A bookmark manager app. Wait!!!! This is not a toy/simple app. This is really insane! If you are a tech enthusiast, you might collect many resources from the internet and store them in browser bookmarks or a note‑taking app. This app will save you from cluttered organization of links. You can store links in this app by categorizing them into folders, and all links will be saved in the cloud with your account. You can access them from your phone, PC, or the web.
- [YTDLnis](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis) - A modern, clean, ad‑free YouTube video downloader.
- [Seal](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.junkfood.seal/) - Another cool YouTube video downloader.

- [Lightning](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/acr.browser.lightning/) - An ultra‑fast, lightweight web browser but not very mature. I love it only for its lightning speed ⚡ to get a premium experience on my low‑budget phone.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 👨‍💻 Coding

- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) - A Linux‑based terminal emulator for Android. It offers a terminal UI similar to Linux. Really amazing for programmers. You can use/run: Node.js, Next.js apps, Python, Java, C, shell scripts, Git, etc. `I used Termux, Acode, and Eruda (console for the browser) on my Android phone to learn MERN‑stack web development in 2022. I developed apps from 2022‑2024 on my phone.`
- [Acode](https://github.com/) - While there are many code editors for Android, this one is insane! If you ask me to suggest the best code editor for Android, I would suggest Acode. I used it a lot and got a VS‑Code‑like vibe. I've explored other editors, but this one is my favorite. It has plugins like VS‑Code extensions, theme & font customization, and a snippets feature for auto‑completing code.
- [Hacker's Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/) - The best keyboard for coding & hacking—that's why it's called Hacker's Keyboard. It contains Ctrl, Alt, Function, Del, etc., keys that are not present on normal keyboards.
- [Restler](https://restler-rest-api-client.en.softonic.com/android) - As programmers, we often need to test APIs. We do it on Postman or other apps on a PC. But for phones, Restler is the best solution. I used it a lot during backend development on Android.

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">↑ Back to Top</a></p>

## 🧩 Miscellaneous

- [Offline Translator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.davidv.translator/) - As the name suggests, it allows you to translate text without an internet connection.
- [Offline OCR](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.subhamtyagi.ocr/) - A minimal, ad‑free OCR app. You can extract text from photos offline.
- [Flashy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=) 🔦 - An interesting app. On my phone, when the battery gets below 15% charge, my flashlight can't be turned on due to the phone's restriction/feature. That's why I started using this app. It allows you to use the screen/display as a flashlight. When you turn on the flashlight inside this app, it increases the brightness to 100% and also offers a color picker.
- [Clima](https://f-droid.org/es/packages/co.prestosole.clima/) - An open‑source, ad‑free, minimal weather application. `Also try this one if you want more modern weather app: Breezy Weather`
- [OSS Document Scanner](https://github.com/Akylas/OSS-DocumentScanner) - A free and ad‑free document scanner. I use it as an alternative to the bloated CamScanner app. It has an elegant and minimal UI.
- [QR Code Scanner](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-qr-scanner) - An ad‑free, minimal, elegant QR‑code scanner app.
- [Camera](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Camera) - I don't like my phone's default camera because it is bloated with so many features and didn't get good ux/performance. And, this camera app is a lightweight and minimal that's why i replace my phone's default camera with it.
